            <span class="name"><br>My Beloved Nidah<br></span>,

Every time I sit down to write about you, I find myself lost in thoughts of everything you mean to me. How do I put into words a feeling so deep, so powerful, that it takes over my whole heart and soul? <span class="name">Nidah</span>, loving you is the most beautiful thing that has ever happened in my life, and I want you to know just how much you mean to me.

From the moment you became a part of my life, everything changed. The world became brighter, my days became sweeter, and my nights became warmer because I know that somewhere out there, I have someone as precious as you thinking of me too. You are the reason I smile for no reason, the reason my heart beats faster, the reason I dream bigger. Youâ€™ve turned my life into something magical, and I never want this feeling to end.

I love the way your name soundsâ€”itâ€™s like music to my heart. I love the way your presence calms me, the way your words bring peace to my mind, and the way your love gives meaning to everything I do. Nidah, you are not just someone I care about; you are the center of my world, the queen of my heart, and the most beautiful part of my life.

When I think about the future, I see you in every dream I have. I see us walking together through lifeâ€™s ups and downs, holding each other close, building a love that grows stronger every single day. I donâ€™t just want you in my lifeâ€”I need you. You are my sunshine on the darkest days, my strength when I feel weak, my everything when I feel like I have nothing.

If I could take all the stars from the sky and give them to you, I wouldâ€”because even the brightest star cannot outshine the light you bring into my life. If I could write your name on every piece of sand on every beach, I wouldâ€”because I want the world to know that my heart belongs to you and only you.

Nidah, I want you to know this: I am yours. Every heartbeat, every breath, every thoughtâ€”I give it all to you. You are my one, my only, my forever. No matter where life takes us, I promise you thisâ€”I will love you today, tomorrow, and every single day after that, for the rest of my life.

Thank you for being youâ€”so beautiful, so loving, so amazing. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I will never stop loving you. My heart, my soul, my everythingâ€”itâ€™s all yours, Nidah.

Forever and always,
<span class="signature">Wayne</span>
