# Love Letter Webpage

A beautiful romantic love letter webpage with animated background, floating images, and background music.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view locally
3. For GitHub Pages deployment:
   - Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
   - Configure GitHub Pages settings:
     - Source: main branch
     - Folder: / (root)
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
   - Do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to see changes

## File Structure

```
your-repo/
├── index.html       # Main HTML (renamed from love_letter.html)
├── styles.css
├── script.js
├── Wayne.jpeg
├── babe.jpeg
├── nida.jpeg
└── audio/          # Audio directory
    └── alone-296348.mp3
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a file list instead of the webpage:
  - Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
  - Check GitHub Pages settings
  - Do a hard refresh

- If images or audio aren't loading:
  - Verify file paths in HTML
  - Check file extensions and case sensitivity
  - Ensure files are committed and pushed
